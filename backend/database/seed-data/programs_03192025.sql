Chemical engineers with some understanding of bioprocesses are needed to scale up production from laboratory to pilot into the industrial level. In the long run, local processing of raw materials into consumer and industrial products should help raise rural income, generate foreign exchange and protect the Philippine economy from adverse external trade conditions. Students in this program may take the general curriculum or the major in Sugar Technology or Pulp and Paper Technology options. These curricula require 15 units of GE Core courses, 9 units of GE Elective courses, 3 units of a legislated course, 46 units of foundation courses in basic sciences (Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry), and 20 units of general engineering courses. The general curriculum includes 54 units of Chemical Engineering courses and 6 units of cognate courses which may be chosen from the following fields: statistical modeling, forest products and paper science, management, scientific and technical communication, environmental chemistry, biotechnology, food microbiology, economics, sugar engineering, food engineering, dairy technology, entrepreneurship, and technopreneurship. In addition, a 3-unit internship course provides on-the-job training and experience for graduating students. Finally, 6 units are devoted to either of the following 3 options: undergraduate thesis, innovationeering or engineering industry research, to provide the student experience in integrating and applying his technical knowledge in solving industrial processing problems and generating new technologies relevant to agri-based industries.', 1, NULL, NULL, 21, 'YES', NULL),
